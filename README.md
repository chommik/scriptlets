SCRIPTLETS by chommik
=====================

Every script inside has README. This one applies to the main Makefile.

Makefile commands are:

* install - to install all of them
* $scriptname - to install one
* check - to show, what is installed

Self-documenting variables are in Rules.mk. No other files need to be modified.

Hope something will be useful.
